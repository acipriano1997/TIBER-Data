"""Build TIBER_IDENTITY_CROSSWALK_V2 from operator-authorized candidate rows (issue #241).

V2 exists because of one semantic change: `tiber_player_id` is a GSIS player id
rather than a `tiber-data-player-2025-*` slug. FORGE_PLAYER_STATIC_V1 is now
GSIS-keyed, so a V1-vocabulary crosswalk resolves to zero FORGE rows while still
reporting players as crosswalk-matched downstream. Per AGENTS.md rule 6 the
contract is versioned rather than mutated: V1's schema, builder, validator, and
promoted artifact are left untouched and still pass their own checks.

Two slices are promoted, both in the GSIS vocabulary:

  1. every candidate row whose tiber_player_id appears in the pinned
     FORGE_PLAYER_STATIC_V1 artifact (the join the consumer needs), and
  2. every provider id already present in the promoted V1 crosswalk, so prior
     operator-verified coverage is carried forward rather than dropped.

Both source artifacts are pinned by sha256, so the promoted slice is
reproducible and auditable from the artifact alone.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/promote_identity_crosswalk_rows.py \
      --forge-artifact /path/to/forge_player_static_v1.json \
      [--forge-artifact-ref TIBER-FORGE:exports/promoted/forge_player_static/forge_player_static_v1.json] \
      [--forge-sha256 <expected sha256>] \
      [--candidates exports/candidates/identity_crosswalk/identity_crosswalk_candidates_v0.json] \
      [--existing exports/promoted/identity_crosswalk/tiber_identity_crosswalk_v1.json] \
      [--out exports/promoted/identity_crosswalk/tiber_identity_crosswalk_v2.json] \
      [--generated-at 2026-08-09T00:00:00Z] [--check]

--forge-artifact may be a local copy of the upstream file; --forge-artifact-ref
is the durable identity recorded as provenance, and --forge-sha256 pins the
exact bytes so a different file at the same path cannot silently promote a
different slice.
