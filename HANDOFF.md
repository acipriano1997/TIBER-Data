# TIBER-Data — Working Handoff

## Repo purpose in one sentence

TIBER-Data stores canonical contracts and deterministic football data artifacts for downstream repos.

## Current agent workflow

Typical loop:
1. Lamar defines scope and boundary
2. Codex implements the narrow change
3. Claude audits when needed
4. merge only if the repo remains honest

## When a task arrives

Ask:
1. Is this a contract task, a data artifact task, or a repo-governance task?
2. Does this repo already hold the source truth needed?
3. If not, should scope be reduced or should the task move elsewhere?

## If a mistake or uncertainty appears

First call:
- README
- contracts
- export code
- tests
- committed raw support files

If still unclear:
- Lamar decides whether the task is honest
- Claude audits if a builder may have overreached

## Handoff note format

Every material handoff should state:
- active task
- files touched
- audit-trigger status: not triggered, Claude audit happened, Claude audit pending, or Claude audit skipped with reason
- what is now true
- what is still missing
- what must not be assumed

Example:
- Active task: extend supported weekly artifact generation
- Files touched: raw support fixtures, export validation, tests, README
- Now true: W1–W6 supported and fail-closed
- Missing: honest raw support beyond W6
- Must not assume: W7+ exists unless committed support is present

## Current handoff — #236 historical landing-context design/evidence pilots

- Active task: design the minimum cutoff-aware historical landing-context
  candidate interface and reproduce bounded April 2023 evidence/gaps for BAL,
  IND, and LAR, stacked on the #237 identity candidate.
- Files touched: a candidate-only source-assertion fixture and draft schema,
  deterministic builder/validator, focused tests, three pilot artifacts and
  bundle manifest/validation, a source availability report, interface/handoff
  documentation, and this handoff. No governed schema or promoted path changed.
- Audit-trigger status: independent final artifact audit completed before draft
  PR handoff. Three read-only reviews established source gaps, temporal/team
  boundaries, frozen-pilot discrepancies, and the minimum validator surface,
  then verified strict commit/blob/hash replay, source-row fidelity, resolved
  missingness paths, cutoff semantics, typed available/unavailable branches,
  and fail-closed ownership/terminal boundaries. The final focused suite passed
  26/26 and the full repository suite passed 565 with 1 skipped.
- What is now true: all three pilots bind by exact GSIS through #237 version and
  hash; draft assignments are projected without names or later history; 2022
  single-team player-season rows are reproducible but stay unadmitted because
  source availability by cutoff is unproven; multi-team rows are excluded from
  diagnostic subtotals; raw 2022 Rams `LA` stays blocked rather than silently
  normalized; complete team/vacated values and roster, transaction, QB,
  coaching, offense, and injury families remain explicit nulls; interpretations
  are structurally empty.
- What is still missing: operator ownership decisions, immutable cutoff-safe
  roster/transaction/coaching/injury sources, team-split multi-team usage, a
  supported 2022 Rams alias if desired, exact pick-time policy, a durable
  GSIS-to-governed-TIBER-ID edge, operator acceptance, and any later promotion
  proposal.
- What must not be assumed: candidate presence is not interface readiness;
  prior-season usage is not returning roster/depth truth; partial subtotals are
  not team totals; null vacancy is not zero; the EOD cutoffs are proxies; frozen
  Rookies references are not Data fact authority; no ownership or terminal
  decision was made; no model, Forecast, promotion, or Rookies mutation is
  authorized.

## Current handoff — #237 2023 rookie identity crosswalk candidate

- Active task: TIBER-Data #237 builds a versioned, candidate-only 80-player
  2023 QB/RB/WR/TE identity census across pinned Rookies GSIS/slug assertions,
  exact-GSIS TIBER-Data source-player identities, the explicit unresolved
  governed TIBER canonical namespace, and fail-closed Forecast row
  conflicts.
- Files touched: a pinned source-assertion snapshot, deterministic builder and
  validator, focused tests, candidate crosswalk/conflict/manifest/validation
  artifacts, the identity contract, paired audit reports, and this handoff.
- Audit-trigger status: independent final artifact audit completed before draft
  PR handoff. Read-only reviews informed the source pins, conflict scope, and
  alias boundary, then verified the TIBER namespace split, explicit override
  lineage, bounded impact inventory, source-scoped team policy, and exact
  Forecast-row fingerprint binding. The final re-audit found no blocker.
- What is now true: all 80 census rows are represented; exact GSIS resolves 76
  promoted Data source-player IDs (68 in 2023 REG, eight first observed later),
  while four stay explicit nulls; the distinct governed `tiber_player_id`
  namespace stays null and blocked for all 80 because V1 has no admissible GSIS
  edge; all eight audited Forecast 2023-subject rows use explicit non-name
  fingerprint overrides marked `needs_operator_review` and stay conflict-blocked;
  five raw-ID collisions are separately ledgered; Puka's
  Forecast `00-0038543` claim remains distinct from governed `00-0039075`;
  `LAR` is canonical with a directed source/date-scoped `LA→LAR` rule; and
  downstream consumers must verify crosswalk version `0.1.0` plus SHA-256.
- What is still missing: an operator-owned durable GSIS-to-`tiber_player_id`
  edge, operator review of Forecast subject overrides, any promotion/governance
  decision, and the operator's disposition for already-emitted Forecast artifacts.
- What must not be assumed: structural validation does not resolve or admit a
  Forecast edge; the bounded #236 pilot may use only the manifest-bound
  GSIS-to-Data-source-player edge; proposed Rookies slugs are not promoted IDs;
  neither the four missing Data records nor V1 descriptors permit minted or
  name-joined TIBER IDs; no Forecast, Rookies, governed
  schema, or promoted export was mutated; and no rerun, correction,
  supersession, or promotion is authorized.

## Current handoff — NFL Draft results v1 contract foundation

- Active task: implement issue #112 by adding the first-pass canonical NFL Draft results contract, one-year fixture validation path, and documented promoted export boundary.
- Files touched: `src/contracts/v1/nflDraftResults.ts`, `src/contracts/v1/index.ts`, `test/fixtures/nfl_draft_results_2026.contract_fixture.json`, `test/nflDraftResults.v1.test.ts`, `docs/data/nfl-draft-results-v1.md`, `README.md`, `HANDOFF.md`.
- Audit-trigger status: Claude audit pending/required by repo policy because this change adds a contract under `src/contracts/v1/` and documents promoted export semantics.
- What is now true: the v1 row contract validates required draft result fields, positive pick integers, ISO timestamps, nullable source URLs, and explicit unresolved-player-ID provenance states; the future promoted path is documented as `exports/promoted/nfl_draft_results/nfl_draft_results_{year}.json`.
- What is still missing: repo-held official NFL Draft result source files with clear provenance and any promoted official draft result artifacts.
- What must not be assumed: the fixture row is not an official draft fact, no year has full draft coverage, TIBER-Data does not own TIBER-Rookies scoring or prospect interpretation, and FORGE does not consume raw draft facts from this PR.

## Current handoff — #181 governed Teamstate coverage audit for Forecast gate

- Active task: audit/verify complete governed 2024 Teamstate source coverage for the Forecast Run 2 coverage gate (TIBER-Data #181). Upstream coverage only; no Forecast change, no Run 2 rerun, no FORGE, no product output.
- Files touched: `docs/data/team-week-raw-v0-2024-teamstate-coverage-audit.md`, `scripts/audit_team_week_raw_v0_2024_teamstate_coverage.py`, `tests/test_audit_team_week_raw_v0_2024_teamstate_coverage.py`, `exports/candidates/team_week_raw/team_week_raw_v0_2024_teamstate_coverage_audit.json`, `HANDOFF.md`.
- Audit-trigger status: this change *is* a Claude audit (read-only verification + durable report); no artifact rows were produced or mutated.
- What is now true: TIBER-Data already holds a complete governed 2024 `team_week_raw_v0` source — 32/32 teams, 544/544 played team-game rows, explicit governance marker, source/validation/lineage provenance, deterministic ordering, honest deferred (`pressureRateAllowed`) and absent (fantasy split) nulls with no zero-fill. A dependency-free audit + tests re-prove this from the committed artifact.
- What is still missing: nothing on the TIBER-Data side. The Forecast 3-team failure is a downstream handoff gap — TIBER-Teamstate must emit its Forecast-facing artifact from this governed 544-row source (full mode, not `--excerpt`/scaffold).
- What must not be assumed: this does not claim Teamstate or Forecast "works"; it does not run Forecast; it does not source pressure or fantasy splits; deferred/absent fields stay null and must never be zero-filled downstream.

### Current handoff — #220 2015–2020 candidate-build design accepted; implementation inactive

- Active task: TIBER-Data #220 completed the documentation-only design frontier for a bounded 2015–2020 REG `player_season_coverage_v0` candidate. The accepted design is `docs/design/player-season-coverage-v0-2015-2020-candidate-build-spec.md`, accepted at PR #221 head `17d50febffbf087e7faec31157bc406a561a5fd4`, design blob `27aae171cb7b4138b272af32e42e06bb147900b2`. This is a design result only; candidate implementation remains inactive.
- Files touched: the accepted design document and this `HANDOFF.md` state synchronization. No builder, test, source, schema, validator, data, export, manifest, report, README, promoted artifact, Forecast file, or other repository file changed.
- Audit-trigger status: independent design review completed through five hardening rounds. Findings addressed included multi-file publication and rollback semantics, test-matrix consistency, first-run absence restoration, structural source-fingerprint binding, value-level hashing across both source frames and identity inputs, residue preflight, exact 1.0 identity joins, and removal of the publishable provisional-identity path.
- What is now true: an implementation-ready specification exists for a new bounded historical builder producing exactly 2015–2020 REG candidate rows. It requires nflreadpy `0.1.5`, exact agreement with the accepted #218 structural fingerprint, thirteen deterministic source-content hashes, exact 1.0 identity joins, no provisional published identities, weeks 1–17 independently for every season, `full_season` at 14 or more observed week numbers, games above 16 only through source-backed multi-team evidence and never above 17, unchanged schema and validator reuse, phase-0 residue preflight, journaled set publication, deterministic output, fail-closed drift handling, and the normative test matrix. Its terminal decision is `may_activate_player_season_coverage_2015_2020_candidate_build`.
- What is still missing: a separate explicit G2 operator decision activating implementation. No historical builder, tests, candidate rows, manifest, validation result, or build reports exist. Candidate execution, independent artifact audit, candidate acceptance, promotion proposal, promotion, and Forecast availability each remain separate gates.
- What must not be assumed: G1 acceptance is not implementation authority and does not mean a candidate exists. The promoted player-season window remains 2021–2025 REG only. “2015–2025 is available” remains prohibited. No promotion, Forecast, ADP, rebound research, rankings, projections, advice, or product behavior is authorized.

### Current handoff — #222 G2 candidate-builder implementation accepted; G3 run inactive

- Active task: TIBER-Data #222 completed the implementation-only G2 frontier for the bounded 2015–2020 REG `player_season_coverage_v0` candidate builder. The implementation was accepted at PR #223 head `dff6597ee3bcd9f0255e34c1ad02534c26ea9402`; builder blob `0c7fe1bb5885c75a09d7d461bbb7ce480b1fe3e9`; offline-test blob `9a10deac2f32266a1c73f465b5a5fa0ba115422f`. G3 network-backed candidate execution remains inactive.
- Files touched: the bounded historical builder, its offline test module, and this `HANDOFF.md` state synchronization. No candidate artifact, manifest, validation result, build report, data file, export, schema, validator, accepted audit script, accepted design document, 2021/2022–2025 builder, promotion manifest, README support claim, Forecast file, or other repository file changed.
- Audit-trigger status: independent review completed through three Codex rounds. Six findings were corrected before acceptance: mandatory post-G5 hash locking, partial-temp tracking, backup-cleanup handling, successful-publication exit semantics, damaged-manifest fail-closed behavior, and complete phase-one cleanup accounting. Final Codex review was clean at the accepted implementation head; all six review threads are resolved.
- What is now true: an independently reviewed offline implementation exists for the bounded 2015–2020 candidate build. It encodes the accepted source fingerprint, thirteen source-content hashes, historical 1–17 week rules, the 14-week full-season threshold, source-backed 17-game handling, exact 1.0 identity joins, unchanged schema/validator reuse, deterministic serialization, residue preflight, journaled set publication, rollback/recovery semantics, promoted-path guards, support-claim guards, and the normative test matrix. Focused tests passed 51/51 and the full repository suite passed 471 with 1 skipped.
- What is still missing: G3 operator authorization for the network-backed candidate run. No live nflreadpy candidate-generation calls have occurred and no candidate rows, artifact, manifest, validation result, or build report exist. Candidate execution, independent artifact audit, candidate acceptance, promotion proposal, promotion, and Forecast availability remain separate gates.
- What must not be assumed: accepted implementation is not candidate evidence, promotion, or consumer availability. The promoted player-season window remains 2021–2025 REG only. “2015–2025 is available” remains prohibited. No Forecast, ADP, rebound research, rankings, projections, advice, or product behavior is authorized.

### Current handoff — #227 bounded 2026 population census v0 candidate

- Active task: implement TIBER-Data #227 as a deterministic, row-preserving candidate census over exactly two governed cohorts: all 610 season-2025 rows from promoted `player_season_coverage_v0` and all 48 rows from TIBER-Rookies' promoted 2026 rookie-transition profile v0.2.
- Files touched: `schemas/bounded_2026_population_census_v0.schema.json`, `scripts/build_bounded_2026_population_census_v0.py`, `scripts/validate_bounded_2026_population_census_v0.py`, `tests/test_bounded_2026_population_census_v0.py`, `exports/candidates/population_census/bounded_2026_population_census_v0.json`, its validation report, `docs/contracts/bounded-2026-population-census-v0.md`, `docs/reports/bounded-2026-population-census-v0-coverage.md`, and this handoff.
- Audit-trigger status: independent audit pending/required because the change adds a contract, cross-repository source provenance, deterministic builder/validator behavior, and a generated candidate artifact.
- What is now true: the candidate contains exactly 658 rows with stable unique `population_row_id` values, source-row hashes, exact repository/commit/path/content pins, explicit team/position/history/identity states, losslessly associated per-field/per-source-ref cutoff evidence, and itemized reconciliation. It reconstructs byte-identically from the immutable source git blobs. No fuzzy or display-name join is used; all 48 rookie source IDs remain canonically unresolved, so cross-source canonical collision evaluation is explicitly unevaluable rather than reported as zero.
- What is still missing: independent artifact/contract audit, operator acceptance/merge, and any separately governed downstream cutoff/admission decision.
- What must not be assumed: this is not a full active-player universe, complete rookie class, IDP census, current roster, promoted artifact, Forecast authorization, ranking, advice, or production activation. The 610 historical teams are 2025 source context only. TIBER-Data #227 does not authorize the parked 2026 Forecast candidate run.

### Current handoff — #228 generic PPR scoring reconciliation evidence

- Active task: reconcile the exact generic full-PPR profile approved in TIBER-Data #228 against every 2021–2025 REG QB/RB/WR/TE row in the promoted `player_season_coverage_v0` artifact, without changing the promoted source or authorizing downstream use.
- Files touched: the versioned reconciliation declaration under `docs/contracts/`, the dependency-free reconciliation builder and tests, candidate per-row/discrepancy/missingness evidence under `exports/candidates/scoring_reconciliation/`, the evidence manifest, the human report, and this handoff.
- Audit-trigger status: independent audit pending/required before merge because the change adds a contract, generated candidate evidence, source/provenance semantics, and a downstream handoff claim. Builder self-review and deterministic tests are complete; they are not represented as independent audit.
- What is now true: the exact promoted source bytes are pinned at `d45f612b207085df00b4b080e4f55ce1abbd060dcbf30b0bee777ff833ddd8ac`; all 3,016 rows have the eight approved profile components and a source total; every row has an explicit full/partial/single-week/missing/irreconcilable completeness state and reconciliation status; after independent cent-scale `ROUND_HALF_UP` normalization, 2,186 source totals match exactly while 830 are preserved mismatches; raw serialization residue is diagnostic only and the v1 nonzero tolerance is 0.00; component-derived generic PPR is complete candidate evidence; source `season_ppr` is not profile-equivalent across the population. The terminal decision is `scoring_reconciliation_evidence_ready`.
- What is still missing: independent artifact/contract review, operator acceptance, and a separate Forecast-side admission decision. The promoted source did not pin the exact historical nflreadpy/nflverse release; a commit-pinned current official producer formula is used only as semantic corroboration.
- What must not be assumed: no promoted byte or source total changed; no mismatch component was inferred; no weekly rows were reconstructed; no scoring-policy disposition, Forecast cutoff/model/run, #170 execution, promotion, deployment, ranking, advice, or league-specific scoring is authorized.

### Current handoff — #234 Slice B rb_contact_evasion_observations_v0 candidate bundle gate

- Active task: implement TIBER-Data #234 Slice B — a deterministic, offline, fail-closed manifest/digest validation gate for future `rb_contact_evasion_observations_v0` candidate bundles, delegating all semantic judgment to Slice A's canonical compiled evaluator; then repair the independent Codex review's three findings against PR #260 head `4f9591af3ebbcabea965b689e7b95ab8b821d4c1`.
- Files touched: `scripts/validate_rb_contact_evasion_bundle.py` (gate), `scripts/rb_contact_evasion_contract_bridge.mjs` (thin execution bridge), `scripts/rb_contact_evasion_evaluator.tsconfig.json` (build surface), `schemas/rb_contact_evasion_observations_bundle_manifest_v0.schema.json` (manifest shape gate), `tests/test_rb_contact_evasion_bundle_gate.py` (boundary + mutation controls), `docs/contracts/rb-contact-evasion-observations-v0-bundle-gate.md`, `test/fixtures/rb_contact_evasion/bundle/` (reference bundle: manifest + two synthetic artifact copies), `package.json` (`check:rb-contact-evasion-bundle`), the paired review-repair audit under `docs/audits/rb-contact-evasion-observations-v0-bundle-gate-review-repair-2026-08-25.{md,json}`, and this handoff. No Slice A contract, schema, dictionary, reason codes, or fixtures changed; nothing under `exports/**` changed.
- Audit-trigger status: **triggered** (adds a schema under `schemas/` and a validation surface deciding what a future governed artifact may claim). An independent Codex review at head `4f9591af…` produced three findings (two P1 governance, one P2 read-race); those are recorded and repaired in the paired `docs/audits/` record. **Final exact-head audit remains pending fresh Codex review of the repaired head** — this work is not independently reviewed at the repaired head and is not declared so.
- What is now true: the gate is descriptor-bound and fail-closed. It validates the manifest and pinned contract identity before trusting payload claims; pins the artifact id, schema version, and admitted digest algorithm in code (cross-checked against a contract compiled from reviewed source, never from `dist/`); enforces safe relative paths, bundle containment, exact manifest↔bundle bijection, and rejects absolute/traversal/symlink/non-regular paths. Every bundle file is now read through one `O_NOFOLLOW` descriptor whose type and size are validated by `fstat` on that descriptor and read with a bounded read from it, so an oversized replacement, FIFO, device, symlink, or growth after the check fails closed without a stat-then-reopen race and without unbounded reads. Byte size and SHA-256 are checked before JSON parse; malformed JSON with a matching digest is rejected; the committed JSON Schema shape gate is applied; semantic judgment is delegated to Slice A's canonical evaluator with its exact reason codes preserved verbatim; the semantic stage receives the exact verified in-memory bytes and never reopens the pathname. The gate performs no network access and mutates no validated input. P1–P9 remain accepted and N1–N49 remain rejected for their exact existing reason codes through the boundary.
- What is still missing: fresh Codex exact-head review of the repaired head; operator acceptance/merge; and the admitted-source registry, which stays unimplemented because no source is admitted (there is nothing to pin against, and a registry would invent provenance). The `#224` promotion gate is not this gate.
- What must not be assumed: this is not an admitted source, a candidate artifact, a promoted artifact, or a promotion decision; the reference bundle is a synthetic gate fixture, not football evidence; passing the gate proves bytes and file identity, not football truth; `node_modules`, the pinned TypeScript compiler binary, and Node remain trusted and out of scope; and the committed review-repair record is not an independent audit of the repaired head.

### Handoff amendment — #234 Slice B second review round (2026-08-26)

- Active task: repair the two findings from the follow-up independent Codex review of PR #260 at head `96c332149e6411c51ecd6839afbe922a5a1ca499`.
- Files touched: `scripts/validate_rb_contact_evasion_bundle.py`, `tests/test_rb_contact_evasion_bundle_gate.py`, `docs/contracts/rb-contact-evasion-observations-v0-bundle-gate.md`, and the paired `docs/audits/rb-contact-evasion-observations-v0-bundle-gate-review-repair-2026-08-25.{md,json}` (amended with a second-round section), plus this handoff. No Slice A change; nothing under `exports/**`; reference bundle byte-identical.
- Audit-trigger status: **triggered**; final exact-head audit **pending fresh Codex review of the repaired head**.
- What is now true (correcting the prior entry): the descriptor-bound read has **no degraded fallback** — if the platform lacks the primitives required to prove no-follow, component-relative access (`O_NOFOLLOW`, `O_PATH`, `O_NONBLOCK`, `dir_fd`), the gate fails closed with `BUNDLE_DESCRIPTOR_UNSUPPORTED` before reading any bundle bytes; it never opens a full path (the earlier "per-component symlink safety is still enforced by `check_path_safety` upstream" claim was wrong, because manifest reading precedes path safety and a path-check-then-open is itself raceable). The bounded read reads at most the cap plus one byte **in total** into **one** growing buffer returned directly to the caller — peak payload ownership is a single buffer plus one small read chunk (measured ~1.25× the payload), not the ~2× of the previous chunk-list-then-join. Post-`fstat` growth and short reads are still detected.
- What is still missing: fresh Codex exact-head review of the repaired head; operator acceptance; the still-unimplemented admitted-source registry (no source admitted).
- What must not be assumed: passing the gate proves bytes and file identity, not football truth; the platform-capability guard is a hard fail-closed, not a portability shim; the toolchain remains trusted and out of scope.

### Handoff amendment — #234 Slice B third review round (2026-08-26)

- Active task: repair four findings from a Codex exact-head review of PR #260 at head `8d2b9cad0488d649657b43d6b1339a6c92bcc0c7` (two P1, two P2). This review was performed in the operator session and relayed by the operator; there is no GitHub connector review object or thread for it (the connector is not its author).
- Files touched: `scripts/validate_rb_contact_evasion_bundle.py`, `tests/test_rb_contact_evasion_bundle_gate.py`, `docs/contracts/rb-contact-evasion-observations-v0-bundle-gate.md`, and the paired `docs/audits/rb-contact-evasion-observations-v0-bundle-gate-review-repair-2026-08-25.{md,json}` (second-round identity corrected, third-round section added), plus this handoff. No Slice A change; nothing under `exports/**`; reference bundle byte-identical.
- Audit-trigger status: **triggered**; final exact-head audit **pending fresh Codex review of the repaired head**.
- What is now true (correcting the prior entry): once the digest matches, `check_integrity` **freezes** the verified bytes into an immutable `bytes` object and both `verified_bytes` and `raw_bytes` reference that single immutable object, so no later stage can flip a byte in place and change what the evaluator judges — the prior code aliased a mutable `bytearray`, and a reproduced JSON-equivalent whitespace swap between integrity and the semantic stage had let the evaluator receive bytes whose SHA-256 no longer matched the manifest digest. The memory claim is corrected: the bounded reader still owns a single buffer and makes no whole-payload copy (that property is **scoped to the reader**, not the whole lifecycle); the freeze is a deliberate one-time per-artifact copy that is now disclosed rather than hidden behind a single-buffer claim. The capability matrix now proves **zero** `os.open`/`os.read` after the preflight fails by instrumenting the real boundary (the prior test only checked the result text, with a vacuous `secret[:0]` term). The second-round audit's reviewer identity is corrected (operator-relayed Codex review, no GitHub connector object). Stale `pathname stat` / `no whole-payload copy` wording is reconciled across the gate, contract doc, and audit; the evidence cutoff includes 2026-08-26.
- Focused test count: `pytest --collect-only` = **288** node IDs at the repaired head = 284 at `8d2b9ca` (collect-only) + 4 new (1 open/read control + 3 P1 identity regressions). Lineage via collect-only in isolated worktrees: 248 → 263 (+15) → 284 (+21) → 288 (+4). (Corrected in the fourth round: this line originally read "262 → 284 (+22) → 288 (+4)" — the first repair round had undercounted its 15 additions as 14, and the third round compounded the error by trusting the recorded 262 instead of re-counting the base; the second round's "+21" was correct.) Full Python suite 1009 passed / 3 skipped (1005 at the prior head + the 4 new focused tests). Mutation testing: 4 mutations against the real gate, all killed, no degenerate, gate restored byte-for-byte.
- What is still missing: fresh Codex exact-head review of the repaired head; operator acceptance; the still-unimplemented admitted-source registry (no source admitted).
- What must not be assumed: passing the gate proves bytes and file identity, not football truth; the reader is still single-buffer (the round-2 chunk-list/join double representation is gone from the reader), while the integrity freeze deliberately and transiently owns the `bytearray` and its immutable `bytes` copy together — a disclosed, momentary, per-artifact double-payload peak at the freeze, not an undisclosed structural one in the reader; the toolchain remains trusted and out of scope.

### Handoff amendment — #234 Slice B fourth review round (2026-08-26, evidence reconciliation only)

- Active task: correct one P2 evidence-reconciliation finding from a Codex exact-head review of PR #260 at head `8c484931255ea5edb4de7923a30b2d8434b8ebfa`, which **accepted the functional repairs** (mutable-alias freeze, capability no-access instrumentation, corrected reviewer provenance). Operator-relayed, no GitHub connector review object or thread. Comments and governance text only — no gate behavior changed, so no mutation evidence is claimed for this round.
- Files touched: `scripts/validate_rb_contact_evasion_bundle.py` (two stale comments/docstrings), `tests/test_rb_contact_evasion_bundle_gate.py` (module docstring), the paired `docs/audits/rb-contact-evasion-observations-v0-bundle-gate-review-repair-2026-08-25.{md,json}` (lineage corrections + fourth-round section), and this handoff. No Slice A change; nothing under `exports/**`; reference bundle byte-identical.
- Audit-trigger status: **triggered**; final exact-head audit **pending fresh Codex review of the repaired head**.
- What is now true (correcting the prior entries): the focused-test lineage, established by `pytest --collect-only` in isolated worktrees at each historical head, is **248 → 263 (+15) → 284 (+21: 15 parametrized matrix cases + 6 standalone) → 288 (+4)**. The first repair round undercounted its 15 additions as 14 (recording 262 instead of 263); the third round compounded the error by trusting the recorded 262 and deriving "+22" instead of re-counting the base; the second round's "+21" was correct all along. The gate's module comment and `check_integrity` docstring no longer say the read "buffers no more than cap plus one byte" — it reads at most cap + 1 bytes **in total**, with peak reader ownership of one growing buffer plus one bounded read chunk and allocation headroom. The test module docstring no longer says semantic judgment is delegated to a compiled contract under `dist/` — the gate compiles reviewed source into its private temporary build and never trusts ambient `dist/`. The Markdown audit's top-level evidence cutoff is corrected to 2026-08-26.
- What is still missing: fresh Codex exact-head review of the repaired head; operator acceptance; the still-unimplemented admitted-source registry (no source admitted).
- What must not be assumed: a recorded count is not evidence — re-measure at the head in question; the reader is single-buffer while the integrity freeze transiently owns two payload-sized representations, disclosed; the toolchain remains trusted and out of scope.

### Handoff amendment — #234 Slice B fifth review round (2026-08-26, `--json-out` output-publication safety)

- Active task: repair one P2 finding from an **independent GitHub Codex review** of PR #260 at head `e68fc176304699ed5ed815f22836f6b9bb56aea6` (thread `r3864788150`, authored by `chatgpt-codex-connector` — the first genuine connector thread since the first round).
- Files touched: `scripts/validate_rb_contact_evasion_bundle.py` (new `publish_json_out`; `main` rewired), `tests/test_rb_contact_evasion_bundle_gate.py` (8 `--json-out` negative controls + 1 structural test), the paired `docs/audits/…-2026-08-25.{md,json}` (fifth-round section), and this handoff. No Slice A change; nothing under `exports/**`; reference bundle byte-identical.
- Audit-trigger status: **triggered**; final exact-head audit **pending fresh Codex review of the repaired head**.
- What is now true (correcting the prior entry): `--json-out` no longer writes via `Path.write_text()`. Reproduced against the real gate: with `--json-out` a hard link sharing `manifest.json`'s inode, `write_text` followed the shared inode and truncated the validated file (1086→2913 bytes) while the gate returned exit 0; a leaf swapped to a symlink into the bundle after the preflight, and a parent directory swapped to a symlink into `observations/`, likewise corrupted the bundle. The realpath "inside the bundle" preflight cannot see a hard link and is raceable, so it is demoted to a usability guard. Publication now goes through a **fresh staging inode** (`O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY|O_NOFOLLOW`) created relative to the intended output parent opened with `O_NOFOLLOW|O_DIRECTORY`, then a single `os.replace` of the destination **entry** — `rename` never follows the destination, so a hard-linked/symlinked output is repointed at the new inode while the old (possibly bundle-shared) inode keeps its bytes. A refusal or a failed `os.replace` leaves the bundle and any prior output byte-for-byte unchanged; staging litter is cleaned up relative to the pinned dir_fd only. Output bytes and exit codes are unchanged.
- Focused test count: `pytest --collect-only` = **297** node IDs (288 + 9 new: 8 `--json-out` controls + 1 structural). Full Python suite **1018 passed / 3 skipped**. Mutation testing: **5 mutations** against the real publication, all killed, no degenerate, gate restored byte-for-byte.
- What is still missing: fresh Codex exact-head review of the repaired head; operator acceptance; the still-unimplemented admitted-source registry (no source admitted).
- What must not be assumed: passing the gate proves bytes and file identity, not football truth; a pathname `realpath` check is not a safe write guard (it cannot see a hard link and is raceable) — safe publication is staging-inode-then-atomic-replace bound to an `O_NOFOLLOW` parent; the toolchain remains trusted and out of scope.

### Handoff amendment — #234 Slice B sixth review round (2026-08-26, `--json-out` ancestor-symlink + collision-cleanup hardening)

- Active task: repair one P2 from a Codex exact-head review of PR #260 at head `58c69f62728e0c6cf99e5840816a747f0b37d3e6`, finding the round-5 `--json-out` repair incomplete in two ways. The finding was **relayed by the operator in condensed form** because elaborating it tripped a content filter on the operator's Codex account (operator separately contacting support); no GitHub connector review object or thread for this round. Reproduced against the real gate before editing; no gate behavior beyond `--json-out` publication changed; no TypeScript changed.
- Files touched: `scripts/validate_rb_contact_evasion_bundle.py` (new `_open_output_parent_nofollow`; `publish_json_out` reworked), `tests/test_rb_contact_evasion_bundle_gate.py` (removed the superseded deterministic-staging-name control; added ancestor-swap, static-ancestor, and collision controls), `docs/contracts/rb-contact-evasion-observations-v0-bundle-gate.md` (`--json-out` paragraph), the paired `docs/audits/…-2026-08-25.{md,json}` (sixth-round section), and this handoff. No Slice A change; nothing under `exports/**`; reference bundle byte-identical.
- Audit-trigger status: **triggered**; final exact-head audit **pending fresh Codex review of the repaired head**.
- What is now true (correcting the prior entry): the round-5 publisher opened only the **immediate** parent with `O_NOFOLLOW`, which guards just the final path component — so a grandparent swapped to a symlink into the bundle after the realpath preflight was followed, and publication overwrote a bundle artifact (reproduced: 4144→2913 bytes). And the staging name was deterministic (`.{leaf}.rbce-stage.{pid}`), so a `FileExistsError` was resolved by unlinking whatever sat there — deleting an unrelated pre-existing file (reproduced). Now the output parent is resolved by a **component-by-component `O_NOFOLLOW` walk** from a trusted anchor (refusing a symlink at any level, creating missing components via `mkdir` relative to the pinned parent), and the staging inode has a **unique random name** with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL`; a collision is resolved by a new random name, never by unlinking, so no unrelated path is ever deleted, and failure-cleanup removes only the inode the gate created.
- Focused test count: `pytest --collect-only` = **299** (297 − 1 removed deterministic-staging-name control + 3 new: ancestor-swap, static-ancestor, collision). Full Python suite **1020 passed / 3 skipped**. Mutation testing: **5 mutations** against the real publication, all killed, no degenerate, gate restored byte-for-byte (`single_parent_open_follows_ancestor` and `blind_unlink_on_collision` each have a dedicated behavioural kill).
- What is still missing: fresh Codex exact-head review of the repaired head; operator acceptance; the still-unimplemented admitted-source registry (no source admitted).
- What must not be assumed: `O_NOFOLLOW` on a single `open` guards only the final component — a safe output path must be walked component-by-component; a staging cleanup must only ever remove an inode the gate itself created, never a pre-existing entry at a guessable name; the toolchain remains trusted and out of scope.

### Handoff addendum — #234 Slice B sixth round completion (2026-08-26, full handoff posted as PR comment)

- The full sixth-round handoff was durably recorded as operator-authorized PR comment `issuecomment-5431528233` on PR #260 (2026-08-26T21:49:53Z), superseding the earlier "no GitHub object for this round" provenance line (corrected in the audit pair without rewriting round history). The comment instructs that the findings not be attributed to the connector; the record complies.
- Diffing the completed repair against the full handoff: core invariants already satisfied; two required controls were missing and are added in this completion pass — a symlink collider at the staging name (name and target preserved, target bytes intact, publication still succeeds) and ordinary nested-parent creation/replacement (two missing levels created by the walk's dir_fd-relative `mkdir`; no full-path `makedirs` exists; replacement atomic; no staging litter).
- Focused suite **301 collected / 301 passed** (299 + 2); full Python **1022 passed / 3 skipped**; re-run mutation matrix all killed, no degenerate (`blind_unlink_on_collision` now killed behaviourally by both the regular-file and symlink collision controls; `single_parent_open_follows_ancestor` also killed by the nested-parent control). No Slice A change; nothing under `exports/**`; reference bundle byte-identical.

### Handoff amendment — #234 Slice B seventh review round (2026-08-27, `--json-out` write-side capability invariant)

- Active task: repair one blocking P1 from a Codex exact-head review of PR #260 at head `73c89a05bd57ec6e01d6a2c09eb7d66703a1faef`, durably posted through operator-authorized PR comment `issuecomment-5434054902` (referencing operator-authored inline thread `r3867337268`). Both GitHub objects are authored by the operator account, not the connector. The review accepted the sixth-round completion pass. Reproduced against the real gate before editing; no TypeScript changed.
- Files touched: `scripts/validate_rb_contact_evasion_bundle.py` (new `publication_primitives_available`; `publish_json_out` preflight), `tests/test_rb_contact_evasion_bundle_gate.py` (10 write-side capability controls), `docs/contracts/rb-contact-evasion-observations-v0-bundle-gate.md` (`--json-out` paragraph), the paired `docs/audits/…-2026-08-25.{md,json}` (seventh-round section), and this handoff. No Slice A change; nothing under `exports/**`; reference bundle byte-identical.
- Audit-trigger status: **triggered**; final exact-head audit **pending fresh Codex review of the repaired head**.
- What is now true (correcting the prior entry): `descriptor_primitives_available()` gates only the bundle READ path; `main()` still called `publish_json_out` after `validate_bundle` returned `BUNDLE_DESCRIPTOR_UNSUPPORTED`, and the publisher had no capability preflight — so with `_O_NOFOLLOW == 0` the component walk lost its no-follow protection and a post-preflight ancestor swap redirected the failure report into the bundle (reproduced: artifact SHA changed 4144→832 bytes at exit 1). Now `publish_json_out` calls a **separate** `publication_primitives_available()` FIRST — requiring nonzero `O_NOFOLLOW`/`O_DIRECTORY` plus `dir_fd` support for `open`/`mkdir`/replace/`unlink` — and raises `GateUsageError` (exit 2) before touching any output path if a primitive is missing. Read-only primitives (`O_PATH`, `O_NONBLOCK`) are not required by the publication check, so a read-only miss still safely publishes the failure report at exit 1; with `--json-out` omitted a missing publication primitive is inert.
- Portability: the atomic-replace capability is proved by `os.replace` **or** `os.rename` membership in `os.supports_dir_fd` — on this platform `os.replace` is absent from the set while `os.rename` is present and `os.replace(..., src_dir_fd=…)` works, so requiring `os.replace` membership alone would fail closed spuriously (a mutation that does so is killed by every ordinary `--json-out` control).
- Focused test count: `pytest --collect-only` = **311** (301 + 10 new). Full Python suite **1032 passed / 3 skipped**. Mutation testing: **3 mutations** against the real capability guard, all killed, no degenerate, gate restored byte-for-byte (the two guard-bypass mutations killed behaviourally by the public corruption control).
- What is still missing: fresh Codex exact-head review of the repaired head; operator acceptance; the still-unimplemented admitted-source registry (no source admitted).
- What must not be assumed: a read-side capability preflight does not protect the write side — publication needs its own capability proof with a different primitive set; `os.replace` membership in `os.supports_dir_fd` is not portable evidence (accept `os.rename` too); the toolchain remains trusted and out of scope.

### Handoff amendment — #234 Slice B post-merge containment (2026-08-28, disable `--json-out`)

- Active task: contain the independently reproduced publication race that remained after PR #260 merged. The final PR head `660edb1587780242188ce3ebf49caa117c59cc8d` differed from reviewed head `48cb35264bf63b8cde522ede650fa6933ce039df` only in an audit-date field; current `main` is `6762665fefdbc81963f3d0a5708078de6cfba981`.
- Files touched: the bundle gate, its focused tests, the bundle-gate contract, this handoff, and the paired audit record. No Slice A contract, schema, fixture, candidate, promoted export, admitted source, registry, or downstream consumer changed.
- Audit-trigger status: **triggered** because the change removes a publication capability from a governed validation surface. Independent exact-head review is pending; the branch is not approved for merge.
- What is now true: `--json-out` raises usage error `2` before validation or any output-path inspection. The descriptor publisher and all write-side publication helpers are removed. Deterministic machine-readable output remains byte-identical on `--json` stdout. A separate caller may capture stdout only under its own reviewed write boundary.
- Why removal is required: a post-preflight attacker can replace an ordinary real output-parent entry with the real bundle directory. `O_NOFOLLOW` cannot distinguish those two real directories, so the publisher cannot prove the gate's “never mutate the validated bundle” invariant. Removing the write capability closes that class rather than adding another incomplete pathname check.
- Verification: focused bundle-gate collection is **292** tests after retiring 23 publication-success controls and adding four disablement controls. The environment-independent slice is **291 passed**; one existing `strace` path-format assertion failed locally with zero matched opens and is unrelated to changed code. Ruff, `py_compile`, JSON validation, and diff checks pass. Remote exact-head checks and independent review remain required.
- What must not be assumed: merge is not authorized; no candidate artifact exists; no source is admitted; stdout capture is not part of this gate and must not target the validated bundle without a separately proved caller boundary.

## Current handoff — #263 Draft Review evidence admission proposal

- Active task: prepare and independently review four existing candidate identity
  admissions and a bounded 2025 historical descriptive-use permission for
  TIBER-Fantasy #360. This is preparation, not effective admission.
- Files touched: paired `docs/audits/draft-review-evidence-admission-2026-09-07`
  Markdown/JSON, a read-only pinned replay checker, its focused tests, and this
  appended handoff. No source, candidate or promoted export was mutated.
- Audit-trigger status: independent exact-commit review required; durable review
  and any repair/re-review results will be recorded in the linked PR.
- What is now true: four exact proposed V2-compatible name_exact/medium rows,
  source hashes and original candidate clocks are inspectable; historical rows
  and coverage discrepancies are reproducibly enumerated; the proposed consumer
  uses outcomes counts and source weekly shares, excludes ambiguous air-yard
  totals, preserves nulls/clocks and requires attribution. Public-source terms
  documentation was checked without acquiring player data.
- What is still missing: the operator's final admission decision, any subsequent
  additive identity promotion/receipt and consumer integration, and independent
  acceptance of those mechanical changes. The proposal JSON stays inactive.
- What must not be assumed: preparation, tests, review or merging documentation
  grants admission; candidate name evidence is provider-ID agreement; source
  inspection time is acquisition time; all weekly rows agree on position; a
  historical snapshot proves current usage or a forecast. No merges or
  production deployment are authorized.

## Current handoff — accepted Draft Review evidence materialization

- Active task: materialize the operator-accepted four-row extension and bounded
  historical-use receipt for #263 / Fantasy#360 under the existing implementation
  and review/repair authority. No merge or production deployment.
- Files touched: separate accepted receipt, V2 additive artifact, deterministic
  offline materializer, old CLI overwrite guard, matching tests/docs; archived
  proposal audit reads its immutable base so later promotion does not rewrite
  its historical evidence.
- Now true: original68 rows preserved, exactly4 medium/name_exact rows added,
  accepted source/window/field policy retained, legacy CLI cannot silently drop
  the extension. Source/candidate inputs and V1 are untouched.
- Missing: independent exact-head mechanical review and the bounded Fantasy
  consumer implementation/tests. These remain separate from operator acceptance.
- Must not assume: admission is a merge/deployment grant, reviewed source IDs
  are provider-declared agreements, missing timestamps are current clocks, or
  historical data establishes current role/forecast/transaction recommendations.
- Audit-trigger status: independent exact-head review pending in the linked PR.

## Current handoff — Research #22 offline one-game PBP validation/read v0

- Current task update (2026-09-12): the implementation repair/re-review loop completed
  clean at `313d28a1575142feb81d1e44aff4ab7c77efe08d`. Joe assigned a documentation-only
  follow-up to archive the independent receipt in the existing reader document and
  reconcile this handoff. Only these two Markdown files change in this follow-up;
  reader, CLI, initialization module, tests, and all other files remain byte-identical.
- Active task: first PR of the Research #22 2026 PBP scope — a local, read-only
  one-game play-by-play receipt verifier and bounded reader with synthetic tests
  and the requested storage/import compatibility plan, revised after the
  2026-09-10 independent branch review of head `2da2f604` (findings F1–F5 plus
  documentation and error-handling corrections) and the follow-up precheck finding
  R1 (parse_failure mislabeling), and the Codex exact-head review of `0ae4208` on
  PR #269 (C1: a matching tuple with a null game ID was certified; C2: argparse
  usage errors exited 2), and the Codex re-review of `9b88311` (D1: non-positive
  possession ordinal exited 0; D2: a fractional season matched by int truncation;
  D3: a bytes field crashed serialization), and the Codex review of `e3b5c6b`
  (E1: an `LA`/`LAR` alias pair passed as a two-team request; E2: infinite floats
  escaped JSON normalization), and the Codex review of `752dce2` (G1: infinity
  envelopes applied before duplicate/possession processing; G2: malformed byte
  count or digest reached verification; G3: non-calendar dates passed validation),
  and the Codex review of `d77facb` (H1/H2: non-finite play IDs or drives could
  resolve a possession; H3: NaN was collapsed into null before duplicate
  classification; H4: a digest with a trailing newline passed the end anchor), and
  the Codex review of `b8ee0fd` (I1: NaN play IDs formed distinct grouping keys and
  bypassed the comparator; I2: a non-numeric play ID sorted last silently), and the
  Codex review of `84eabe9` (J1: a list- or struct-typed play ID crashed duplicate
  grouping instead of reaching the unresolved path), and the Codex review of the
  merged head `874a96b` (K1: repr-based keys split value-equal non-scalars; K2:
  nested NaN not compared recursively; K3: a non-scalar drive crashed occurrence
  counting; K4: Int64 play IDs above 2**53 lost exact order through float; K5:
  this handoff listed the already-pushed J1 commit as missing), and the Codex review
  of `91710f3` (L1: decimal-spelled integral strings still rounded through float;
  L2: run extension compared drives with raw equality), consolidated into one
  lossless numeric representation and one equivalence relation for every stage,
  and the Codex review of `cf9afee` (M1: a scalar NaN drive was collapsed into
  null before run extension, so a NaN-then-null pair of same-team rows merged into
  one run although the equivalence relation holds them distinct; the raw drive is
  now kept through sequencing and selection alone treats null and NaN alike as a
  missing drive number), and the Codex review of `bd87222` (N1: a numeric `game_id`
  match was rendered to a string and compared against the numeric column in every
  game scan, failing as a parse error; the raw typed ID now drives the scans. N2:
  the drive monotonicity check converted drives through float, so Int64 drives
  above 2**53 collapsed and a decreasing prefix certified a possession; drives now
  use the same classifier and lossless numeric representation as play IDs), and the
  Codex review of `7d55214` (O1: the numeric-string grammar had no magnitude bound,
  so `1e999999999` tried to expand into a billion-digit integer and hung the reader
  from the row sort, outside any bounded stage; numeric strings now live in a bounded
  domain and the sort is a named processing stage. O2: a NaN or infinite Float64
  `game_id` passed the non-empty check and was certified as a match; non-finite IDs
  are now unusable identity like null and blank ones), and the Codex review of
  `fd31ffd` (P1: an exponent spelling such as `1e9999999999999999999` passed the
  grammar but overflowed the decimal module before the bound checks ran, failing a
  processing stage instead of withholding; the digit count and adjusted exponent are
  now derived from the compact spelling before any Decimal is built. P2: the bound
  was on the adjusted exponent, so `1.1e4000` counted as inside the documented
  10**4000 ceiling; the ceiling and floor are now compared exactly and inclusively),
  and the Codex review of `542593f` (Q1: a List or Struct `game_id` matched and
  loaded but the emitted-event key count put the raw unhashable ID into a set and
  failed at `select_events`; the count now uses the same frozen grouping key as
  duplicate inventory), and the Codex review of `75797cb` (R1: an empty or
  whitespace-only Binary `game_id` passed the blank check because `str(b"")` is the
  non-empty text `b''`, so it was certified; blankness is now judged on the bytes'
  own content. R2: duplicate-key reports emitted the frozen `game_id` key for list
  or struct IDs; they now report the raw value as they already did for `play_id`),
  and the Codex review of `c134a0e` (S1: distinct numeric-string spellings of one
  play ID such as `"1"` and `"1.0"` shared a sort key but not a grouping key, so the
  stable sort kept an arbitrary physical order and certified a possession; tied rows
  are now counted and withhold selection. S2: consecutive same-team drives spelled
  `"2"` then `"2.0"` split into two runs that each counted once yet compared equal,
  so the ordinal advanced without evidence; a prefix containing distinct spellings of
  one numeric drive now withholds as spelling-ambiguous. S3: whitespace-only team
  codes passed request validation and could match an equally blank source identity;
  blank away, home, and possession codes are now usage errors before file access).
  The subsequent Codex review of `a626361` found T1: blank source `posteam` values
  still counted as real teams, allowing an unaccounted possession to certify a later
  ordinal. The repair routes unusable source team codes through the existing
  unattributed-drive gate and uses the same rule in event-window counts, preserving
  every raw source value. Eight synthetic cases cover null, empty, and whitespace
  codes on their own drive and inside an already evidenced drive.
  The review of `ab54d22` found U1–U3: non-integer requested seasons reached source
  matching; list/struct source team identities crashed alias lookup; and possession
  requests could name a team outside the requested matchup. Requested seasons now
  require integers excluding booleans, source home/away codes share the usable-team
  guard while retaining raw conflict evidence, and CLI/library possession requests
  must name a canonical team in the matchup before file access. Twenty-four new
  synthetic cases cover rejection, unresolved identity, conflict retention, and aliases.
  The review of `24581d1` found V1: a usable but out-of-matchup source `posteam`
  still counted as a third real team and could misnumber a later possession. Source
  attribution now requires membership in the already-matched invariant home/away
  pair. Sequencing and event-window counts share that helper; raw values are retained.
  Four synthetic regressions cover an unaccounted drive, an already-accounted drive,
  and evidence after the selected prefix.
  The review of `fa57f96` found W1/W2: Decimal `abs()` rounded a value just above
  the numeric ceiling under the caller's context, and non-string date arguments
  escaped validation as TypeError. Magnitude comparison now uses exact, context-free
  `copy_abs()`, and dates require strings before the full-string/calendar checks.
  Twelve synthetic cases cover low/default/high precision with strict traps and
  exponent limits, near-ceiling play IDs/drives, exact boundaries, and date types.
  The review of `fc6f096` found X1: an unattributed row could reuse an earlier drive
  number outside that drive's attributed boundaries and still certify the prefix.
  A known drive now excuses such a row only inside its matching run's first/last
  row bounds; otherwise selection reports the affected play IDs and withholds events.
  Six synthetic cases cover reused drives, before/after boundaries, and an inside-run
  control. Null/NaN-drive administrative rows retain their existing neutral behavior.
  Owning repository is
  TIBER-Data; Fantasy's old importers and bronze table are reference only.
- Files touched: `src/pbp_one_game/` (new library), `scripts/read_pbp_one_game_offline.py`
  (CLI), `tests/test_pbp_one_game_offline_read.py` (synthetic fixtures),
  `docs/data/pbp-one-game-offline-read-v0.md` (reader doc plus compatibility plan),
  and this handoff. No contract, schema, raw, candidate, promoted, README, or
  support-claim file changed. No new dependency was added.
- Audit-trigger status: **implementation audit completed at `313d28a`.**
  The reader introduces a team alias
  map, game-identity matching, and provenance/status wording, which the pinned
  AGENTS.md treats as identity and source/provenance semantics regardless of
  file path. The [independent result](https://github.com/Prometheus-Frameworks/TIBER-Data/pull/269#issuecomment-5646256106)
  reports no major issues at that head. The committed receipt in
  `docs/data/pbp-one-game-offline-read-v0.md` pins the head/base/tree, source comment,
  code/test blobs, and validation limitations. Review of this documentation-only
  descendant is a separate PR receipt; the archive does not certify its own edits.
- What is now true: the reader hashes exact bytes before parsing and rejects missing,
  wrong-size, wrong-digest, or non-parquet input with no side effect, turns a
  failure in one of four named parquet engine stages into a bounded `parse_failure`
  receipt with its read stage, and returns a defect in its own post-parse processing
  as a distinct `reader_processing_failure` with its stage, never as a parser or
  source failure; requires
  explicit season/calendar-date/away/home whose teams differ after canonicalization
  and well-formed receipt expectations, all validated before file access; resolves
  exactly one game from the five invariant
  identity columns only, never certifies a match whose provider game ID is null or
  empty or whose season is not exactly equal, reporting event-varying and game-level descriptor values
  without using them to reject; reads lazily with the game filter pushed into the
  parquet scan and discloses physical versus logical read scope; distinguishes
  absent/null/explicit-zero/value states and keeps a null play type unknown;
  classifies duplicate keys as identical or conflicting without discarding; derives a
  team's N-th possession from ordered posteam runs bounded by provider drive, never
  equates it with drive number N, and withholds selection when any earlier run, an
  unattributed drive value, or an order-affecting conflicting duplicate could alter
  the count; caps output at 40 events plus two boundaries per side with explicit
  truncation; never invents retrieval, publication, ingestion, or admission; and the
  CLI refuses to write over the input, any alias of it, or any existing path, and
  routes malformed invocations (including a non-positive possession ordinal) to
  exit 3 so exit 2 means only source rejection, normalizes every polars scalar for
  JSON including signed infinities and an explicit NaN envelope at the output
  boundary only (raw scalars including NaN are kept through NaN-aware duplicate
  classification and possession processing, with NaN and non-scalar play IDs and
  drives canonicalized only in equality-consistent grouping keys, NaN-aware
  equality applied recursively at grouping, comparison, and run extension, and one
  lossless numeric representation for play-ID ordering across sorting and the
  conflict check, with a cross-stage consistency test over a shared case set), withholds selection when a play ID is non-finite or non-numeric
  or a prefix drive is non-finite, and bounds any residual serialization failure as
  a processing failure.
  Focused tests pass 254/254 and lint is clean under the repo ruff rules. This repair
  was tested with Python 3.12, Polars 1.44.2's compatibility runtime, pytest 9.1.1,
  and Ruff 0.16.7 in an isolated environment; the standard Polars runtime failed on
  import in this executor before test collection. No dependency declaration changed.
  The full suite was not rerun for this bounded repair. Earlier full-suite receipts
  remain attributed to their own revisions and environments.
- What is still missing: Joe's separate merge/deployment decision after review of the
  receipt-only documentation change on PR #269; an explicitly
  authorized real input (exact bytes and digest) for the NE at SEA 2026-09-09
  offline read; separately, for any claim of verified stored TIBER evidence or any
  durable import, the database-enforced read-only verification of the deployed
  bronze schema and rows and the receipt-contract decision in the compatibility
  plan; a Replit account-level binding check if the operator wants one (the
  operator's read-only Railway inspection established that production deploys only
  from `main`, which is the basis on which the repair commits were pushed).
- Current repair authority: Joe assigned Codex the bounded repair/push/re-review loop
  on 2026-09-12, superseding the per-push approval requirement for this task only
  ([operator handoff](https://github.com/Prometheus-Frameworks/TIBER-Data/pull/269#issuecomment-5645857667)).
  Fable pushed S1–S3 at `a626361` and handed off; it has stopped editing this PR.
  Merge, deployment, real-data access, ingestion, admission, and broader redesign
  remain outside this assignment. The implementation audit is complete; Joe's later
  archival assignment permits these two documentation edits and independent review,
  with no merge or deployment.
- What must not be assumed: this PR does not verify that the 2026 game exists in any
  source or in Railway; synthetic tests prove software behavior only; the reader's
  output is not ingestion, admission, promotion, or a Research activation; no Team,
  FORGE, Forecast, or ledger consumer may read it; the upstream release URL and its
  observed metadata are external observations, not TIBER receipts; the Railway
  receipt does not speak for Replit or any unconnected provider setting.

## Current handoff — #267 three Team historical identity proposals

- Active task: authorized preparation and independent review of exactly Parker
  Washington/9487, Drake London/8112 and Chris Rodriguez/10219. Task class:
  provenance/source audit plus downstream handoff preparation.
- Files touched: paired `docs/audits/team-identity-proposal-2026-09-10` MD/JSON,
  `scripts/audit_team_identity_proposal.py`, focused tests and this append.
- Now true: proposed V2-compatible name_exact/medium rows, exact pinned source
  inspection, collision checks and per-field weekly denominators are reviewable.
  Current promoted 72 rows and accepted receipt remain unchanged.
- Missing: independent exact-head review and operator admission. Review receipt
  belongs in the linked PR; proposal consumer permission remains false.
- Must not assume: preparation/review admits identity, candidate team is current
  or historical team, name matching is provider verification, or missing weeks
  are zeros. No source acquisition, promotion, consumer regeneration, merge or
  production release was performed.
- Audit triggers: identity and source-use/downstream semantics; exact-head
  independent review pending.

## Current handoff — #267 / #268 three-identity admission preparation

- Active task: user-authorized data artifact and downstream handoff preparation
  for exactly Parker Washington/9487, Drake London/8112 and Chris Rodriguez/10219.
  [Authorization](https://github.com/Prometheus-Frameworks/TIBER-Data/pull/268#issuecomment-5627117154)
  covers branch admission/promotion changes and independent review only.
- Files touched: separate Team receipt, additive 75-row V2 artifact, offline
  materializer, archived proposal crosswalk replay adjustment, legacy overwrite
  guard, focused tests, paired mechanical audit, inventory and identity docs.
- Now true: original 72 rows and all source/candidate bytes retained; exactly
  three medium/name_exact additions; previous receipt and archived proposal
  unchanged. Scope/denominators/unknowns remain explicit. Legacy regeneration
  cannot discard the extension. Focused suites pass 74 tests.
- Missing: independent exact-commit review of these mechanical changes, then
  separate operator decisions for merge/deployment and downstream consumption.
- Must not assume: branch preparation activates production or consumers; these
  identities resolve Watson/Lloyd/Dobbins/Gainwell; provider IDs agree; candidate
  JAX context supersedes historical WAS; absent weeks are zero or games played.
  No consumer bundle regeneration, merge, deployment or release performed.
  Data #269 is untouched.
- Audit-trigger status: builder mechanical audit completed; independent exact
  commit review pending and recorded separately in PR #268.

## Current handoff — nineteen historical Team identities, 2026-09-13

- Active task: operator-accepted data artifact and downstream handoff preparation.
- Files touched: additive 94-row V2 crosswalk; separate team_roster_identity_admission_v1
  receipt; new offline materializer/tests; prior CLI overwrite guard/tests; identity
  docs and paired preparation audit.
- Now true: original 75 identities unchanged; exactly nineteen reviewed additions;
  14 medium name_exact, 3 high gsis_direct, 2 high espn_bridge. All reviewed source
  bytes and prior receipts retained. 94 focused tests and deterministic replay pass.
- Missing: independent implementation review; matching Fantasy bundle integration
  and its own validation/review; separate merge/production decisions. Proposal
  review is recorded separately and cannot certify these implementation files.
- Must not assume: Antonio has 2025 evidence, historical teams equal current teams,
  recorded weeks are games played, empty flags establish health/eligibility, or
  historical admission authorizes a roster move, prediction or production release.
- Audit-trigger status: builder mechanical audit completed in the paired
  docs/audits/team-roster-identity-admission-2026-09-13 files; independent
  implementation review pending. Conversation acceptance is recorded in the
  separate receipt without inventing a GitHub operator comment.


## 2026-09-13 — PR #271 P2 index correction

Operator accepted review discussion_r3999767711 and authorized the bounded repair and next review. Updated docs/contracts/promoted-artifacts-index.md to inventory the 94-row revision, 26/8/60 method counts, and nineteen-row preparation receipt. No identity, source, receipt authority, generated artifact or support window changed. This is a documentation/handoff repair; fresh independent review is pending. Merge, promotion and deployment require separate authorization.


## Current handoff — nineteen-player historical promotion, 2026-09-13

- Now true: a separate operator-conversation receipt approves bounded historical use of the exact nineteen prepared identities and matching consumer activation implementation. Earlier receipts, the 94-row crosswalk, all sources and limitations remain unchanged. Antonio Williams is excluded.
- Changes: versioned promotion receipt, deterministic offline materializer, adversarial tests, contract, index and paired mechanical audit. No acquisition, identity matching, predictions or current-team substitution.
- Missing: independent review of these activation changes and separate authorization for merge or any deployment. The corresponding Fantasy consumer must pin this receipt and keep all original 75 profiles unchanged.
- Must not assume: historical-use approval authorizes a production or preview release, roster cuts, transactions, current roles, health or eligibility. Source clocks and original terms receipt remain unavailable.
- Audit status: builder mechanical replay complete; independent implementation review is separate. See docs/audits/team-roster-identity-promotion-2026-09-13.{md,json}.

## 2026-09-14 — Weekly intake/publication preparation

- Active task: authorized next slice following the offline box-score candidate; contract/data-artifact/downstream handoff.
- Files: four new weekly intake/publication/replay scripts, focused publication tests, raw 2025 and schedule snapshots, candidate revision inventory, contract and paired audit reports.
- Now true: repeatable hash-checked CSV intake, committed-source offline preparation, schedule membership coverage, immutable candidate revisions, completed-season raw replay.
- Still missing: source admission, accepted runtime pin, final-status evidence, scheduler, leaders UI, roster identity activation and production release.
- Must not assume: preparation/replay/review grants promotion; schedule scores certify finality; receiving air yards reconcile; missing charting means low usage; source IDs establish ownership.
- Audit: independent review completed with two P2 findings repaired; exact local validation and source pins in `docs/audits/weekly-intake-publication-2026-09-14.{md,json}`. No merge, remote publication, source promotion or deployment.

## 2026-09-15 — Weekly receipt review R6

Bounded data-artifact/downstream validation repair for #273 finding4011499271. Receipt compilation and retrieval ordering now validated, including dated/content-keyed reuse; 36 weekly tests pass. Changed intake validator, publication tests and paired R6 audit. Raw/candidate artifacts unchanged; no acquisition or admission. Independent exact-head review pending. Joe authorizes repair/push/re-review only; stop before merge, activation or deployment.

## 2026-09-15 — Weekly receipt review R7

Downstream finding 4019849956 exposed one producer-side provenance invariant: release asset update must not postdate retrieval completion. Both source assets and immutable-directory paths are covered; 36 weekly tests pass. Raw/candidate artifacts remain unchanged. Fresh review pending; stop before merge, admission, activation, or deployment.

## 2026-09-15 — Weekly receipt review R8

Repaired #273 P2 4020572558 by applying the same release-before-retrieval invariant to schedule receipts. Fresh, retained, and publication-preparation paths share this validator; 37 weekly tests pass. Raw/candidate artifacts unchanged. Fresh review pending; stop before merge, admission, activation, or deployment.

## 2026-09-16 — Weekly review R9

Repaired #273 P2s 4020954441/4020954445: validate optional declared CSV row counts and reject half-supplied schedule directory/commit arguments before reading support. Six regressions failed before repair; 38 weekly tests pass. Raw/candidate artifacts unchanged. Fantasy #386 remains clean at 8dcb5657. Fresh Data review pending; stop before merge, admission, activation, or deployment.

## 2026-09-16 — Weekly review R10

Accepted #273 P2s 4021462803/4021462809 after reproducing three failing subcases. Intake obtains asset metadata before retrieval starts; player/team and schedule validators now enforce update <= start as well as the existing completion bounds. Changed two intake validators, publication tests and paired R10 audit; 39 weekly tests pass, including equivalent-offset equality. Raw/candidate bytes unchanged. Builder audit complete; independent new-head review pending. No new source acquisition, admission, activation, merge or deployment; partial coverage and unknown finality remain.

## 2026-09-16 — Weekly review R11

Accepted #273 P2 4021636349: shared validation now preserves player-completion <= team-start ordering from sequential intake. One regression failed before repair; 40 weekly tests pass after repair, including equivalent-offset shared endpoints. Changed intake validator, publication tests and paired R11 audit. Raw/candidate bytes unchanged. Builder audit complete; independent review pending. Joe's thumbs-up acknowledges seeing the comment; existing repair authority applies, not merge authority. No acquisition, admission, activation, merge or deployment.
