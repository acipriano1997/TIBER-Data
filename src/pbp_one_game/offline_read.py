"""Offline one-game play-by-play (PBP) receipt verification and bounded event read.

Scope (Research #22 first PR, TIBER-Data owning repository):

- Accept an explicitly supplied local source file with an expected byte count and
  expected SHA-256. The exact bytes are hashed BEFORE parsing. A missing file, size
  mismatch, digest mismatch, or unsupported format stops processing with a precise
  rejection and no side effect. There is no download, no replacement path guessing.
- One supported format: parquet (magic-byte checked), read with polars, which is an
  existing declared repository dependency (`pyproject.toml`). No multi-format framework.
  A parquet file that passes the magic-byte check but fails to parse produces a bounded
  `parse_failure` rejection rather than an uncaught exception.
- Require an explicit requested season, date, away team, and home team. Game identity
  is derived from invariant source identity columns only; event-varying and game-level
  descriptor columns are preserved but never used to reject a game. Raw source identity
  values are preserved verbatim. Zero or multiple matching games is an unresolved
  result. No game ID is synthesized; no substitute date or game is ever selected.
- Inspect the source schema before projecting columns. Absent columns, null values,
  explicit false/zero values, and uninspected columns are reported as distinct states.
- Read lazily: the identity scan projects identity columns only, and the game read
  pushes `game_id == <matched>` into the parquet scan so only the located game's rows
  are materialized. Physical row-group I/O is disclosed separately from logical scope.
- Return a local, non-canonical receipt plus a bounded game inventory. Row count and
  distinct (game_id, play_id) count are reported separately; neither is an official
  snap denominator. Duplicated keys are classified as identical or conflicting and are
  never silently discarded.
- Team possession sequence is derived from ordered `posteam` runs bounded by the
  provider drive number. A team's N-th possession is selected only when the provider
  numbering supports that association for the ENTIRE prefix used to count N; any
  earlier null drive, non-contiguous or non-monotone drive, unattributed row carrying
  an unaccounted drive value, or conflicting duplicate that could alter order, team, or
  drive leaves the selection unresolved.
- Output is capped at MAX_EVENT_ROWS event rows plus at most
  MAX_BOUNDARY_EVENTS_PER_SIDE boundary rows on each side, with explicit truncation.
- The only non-reproducible value across runs of the same input and reader revision is
  `receipt.times.processing_time`, and it is never used as ingestion, retrieval, or
  publication time.

This module deliberately imports no network, database, or application code.
