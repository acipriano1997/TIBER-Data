# Promoted Artifacts Index

This page inventories the files committed under `exports/promoted/**`. It is a
navigation aid, not an artifact contract, promotion decision, or source of new
support claims.

> `exports/promoted/` is a location, not itself a provenance guarantee.
> Artifact fields, row-level source labels, manifests, schemas, and the linked
> documentation remain the evidence for each file's actual state.

Inventory basis: committed artifacts in this revision, updated 2026-09-13 for
PR #271's nineteen-row Team identity preparation, following the earlier 75-row
slice (including PR #268's three-row Team admission and PR #266's four-row Draft
Review extension). This inventories 94 committed mappings and preparation
authority. The separate nineteen-player promotion receipt now records bounded historical consumer-use approval; no activation merge or deployment is authorized.

## Reading the index

- **Observed declaration** reports only states explicitly present in the file
  or its linked repository documentation.
- **Observed support window** describes committed rows, not implied support
  beyond them.
- **Producer** names a repository only when existing provenance, ownership
  documentation, or a repository-local generator identifies it. Otherwise it
  is `unknown`.
- `unknown` means the current repository evidence does not prove a value. It
  must not be filled by inference from the directory name or nearby artifacts.
- Several array payloads do not carry an artifact-level version or status
  envelope. For those rows, the version comes from the canonical path and
  linked versioned documentation, while the observed state comes from row-level
  fields and the linked scope statement.

## Known uncertainty

`player_ownership_aliases.json` declares its artifact name, four alias rows, and
row-level builder source strings, but it does not declare an artifact-level
provenance state or producer repository. This index therefore records its
producer as `unknown`.

## Maintenance

Keep this index synchronized in any pull request that adds, removes, or renames
a committed file under `exports/promoted/**`. Updating this page does not, by
itself, promote an artifact or change its contract, support window, provenance,
or downstream availability.
